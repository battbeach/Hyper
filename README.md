A Live, desktop, HTML5 text-editor. You can now code HTML5 websites in real-time on your desktop.

Currently in **alpha** development and not fully ready for coding.

# Install
Go to the Hyper website to download/install -> [http://jawerty.github.io/hyper](http://jawerty.github.io/hyper)

**or** if you're a developer

Clone the github repository 'jawerty/hyper' and hack as you please.

# Usage 
It has a rather basic UI. You type in your code on the **left** and see what your HTML looks like on the **right**.

Moreover, you can open multiple files and **execute javascript within the page**

If you dislike the primary UI color, you can change the color by choosing the 'Change Color' item in the **View** menu-item. **(not stable/persistent yet)**

Overall, the Hyper app is a lightweight development tool that I made to make testing my webpages faster and easier. If you would like to raise an issue/bug or make a pull request, you are more than welcome to and I will do my best to help solve the problem.

Thank you, and happy hacking.
